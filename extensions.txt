Additionally to the official specifications, DCPU++ supports various extensions
to the DCPU-16 assembler:

Integer literals for bases 2 and 8
    Binary: 0b101 == 0B101 == 5
    Octal: 031 == 25

Hexadecimal literals may start with 0X.

DAT command lets the assembler store arbitrary data.
    DAT 0x1234
    DAT "Hello, World!\n\r\t\\\"\'", 0
    DAT "abc", even_labels_are_supported, 123

RESERVE consumes a given amount of memory.
    :buffer RESERVE 64  ; 64 words of memory

Commutative addition of a register and the next word
    SET [2+A], 0
    SET [A+2], 0
